# Note-Management
App to manage your notes in C#

This code allows the user to add, display, and delete notes. Notes are stored in a list called 'note.' 
Upon starting the program, the user can choose one of four options: add a note, display notes, delete a note, or exit the program. 
The task is implemented in a switch statement that handles the user's choice. 
Each option is implemented in a separate case block.
